## Introduction

Othello, also known as Reversi, is a classic board game for two players. The game is played on an 8x8 grid, and the objective is to have the majority of your colored discs on the board at the end of the game.

   ```

## Rules

- Players take turns placing discs on the board with their designated color (black or white).
- A player can only place a disc in a position that will sandwich one or more of the opponent's discs between the new disc and another disc of the player's color.
- When discs are sandwiched, they flip to the color of the current player.
- The game ends when the board is full or no legal moves are possible.
- The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.

## Features

- User-friendly console interface.
- Intelligent computer opponent (optional).
- Support for two-player mode.
- Highlights legal moves for the current player.
- Keeps track of the score.
